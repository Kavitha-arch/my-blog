ISSUE 1
Images not loading 

SOLUTION: removing leading / 
     src="/images/brain/journal.png"
  was changed to
    src="images/brain/journal.png"

Yesss — we’re down to the **last tiny issue** 🎯
Your CSS/fonts/scripts are loading ✅
Only the PNG is 404 ❌

From your screenshot:

```
whispers_sage.png  → 404  text/html
```

Notice it says **text/html**, not image.

That means:

👉 The request is going to a wrong URL
👉 GitHub Pages is returning your index.html instead of the image

---

# 🚨 ROOT CAUSE

Your image path is probably:

```
/images/whispers_sage.png
```

But on a Project Site on GitHub Pages, root `/` is:

```
https://Kavitha-arch.github.io/
```

Your site lives under:

```
/my-blog/
```

So the correct path must be:

```
/my-blog/images/whispers_sage.png
```

---

# ✅ FIX OPTIONS

## ⭐ Option 1 — Use basePath-aware path (best)

In Next.js, reference images like:

```
/my-blog/images/whispers_sage.png
```

---

## ⭐ Option 2 — Use Next.js public folder correctly

If image is in:

```
public/images/whispers_sage.png
```

Then use:

```
<img src={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH}/images/whispers_sage.png`} />
```

But simpler 👇

---

## ⭐ BEST PRACTICE FOR GITHUB PAGES

Since you already set:

```
basePath: "/my-blog"
```

### Use relative path WITHOUT leading slash:

```
<img src="images/whispers_sage.png" />
```

This resolves relative to:

```
/my-blog/
```

✔ Works everywhere
✔ No config needed

---

# 🧠 Why CSS worked but PNG didn’t

CSS was auto-generated by Next with basePath.

Your image path is manually written → missing basePath.

---

# 🔎 Quick test

Open this in browser:

```
https://Kavitha-arch.github.io/my-blog/images/whispers_sage.png
```

If it loads → path issue confirmed.

---

# ❤️ FINAL SUMMARY

Your deployment is now correct 🎉

Only change image paths to either:

### ✅ Recommended

```
images/whispers_sage.png
```

### OR

```
/my-blog/images/whispers_sage.png
```

ISSUE 2
CSS not loading
SOLUTION: add .nojekyll file

CHATGPT:

Perfect — that detail is the **missing puzzle piece** 🧩

If your HTML contains:

```
href="/my-blog/_next/static/chunks/....css"
```

and still 404 ❌ on GitHub Pages…

then the issue is **NOT Next.js anymore**

## 🚨 FINAL ROOT CAUSE

GitHub Pages Project Sites need a special file:

# 👉 `.nojekyll`

Without it, GitHub Pages’ default processor (Jekyll) ignores folders that start with `_`

Your assets live in:

```
/_next/
```

Jekyll silently skips `_next` → files never served → 404

💥 EXACTLY what your Network tab shows.

---

# ✅ THE REAL FIX (this will solve it immediately)

Create an empty file inside **docs** named:

```
.nojekyll
```

(no extension)

So structure becomes:

```
docs/
  .nojekyll   ← IMPORTANT
  index.html
  _next/
  about/
  blog/
```

Commit + push.

---

# 🧠 Why this happens

GitHub Pages assumes Jekyll sites by default.

Jekyll ignores:

* `_next`
* `_assets`
* `_anything`

Next.js relies on `_next` → styles break.

---

# ❤️ This is the #1 GitHub Pages + Next.js trap

Everyone hits this once.

---

# 🚀 After adding `.nojekyll`

Hard refresh:

```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

Your Tailwind styles should instantly appear 🎉
