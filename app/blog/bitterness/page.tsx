            </div>
            <p>
                Anamika sat before the Being, her voice steady but searching.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.question}>
                “I understand how innocence matures into intelligence,” she began.
                <br />
                “My values have not changed. I still care about integrity, fairness, truth.
                <br /><br />
                But something new has appeared in me.
                <br /><br />
                There is bitterness now — especially toward people who violate what I believe is right.
                Earlier, I may have felt helpless in unfair situations, but there was no bitterness.
                No intense urge to correct. Now there is heat. A sharpness.
                <br /><br />
                Why has my brain rewired this way?”
            </p>

            <p className={styles.reply}>
                “Tell me,” it said at last,
                <br />
                “when a sculptor begins with stone, what does it see?”
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>The Uncarved Stone</h2>

            <p className={styles.reply}>
                “In the beginning,” the Being continued, “the stone is whole but undefined.”
            </p>

            <p>
                In youth, the brain is structured for openness. Optimism bias is stronger.
                Social bonding circuits assume reciprocity. The prefrontal cortex predicts
                fairness as a default social contract.
            </p>

            <p>
                Injustice, when encountered, may create sadness or confusion — but not
                necessarily hostility.
            </p>

            <p>Why?</p>

            <p>
                Because the internal model of the world has not yet accumulated repeated
                violations.
            </p>

            <p>
                The stone is smooth then.
                <br />
                Trusting.
                <br />
                Unedged.
                <br />
                Unshaped.
            </p>

            <p>Innocence is neurological generosity.</p>

            <hr />

            <h2>The First Pattern Recognition</h2>

            <p className={styles.reply}>
                “With time,” the Being said, “the brain begins to detect patterns.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Neuroscience calls this predictive updating. Repeated moral violations
                strengthen associative networks between certain behaviors and threat
                detection pathways.
            </p>

            <p>
                The amygdala becomes more efficient — not only at detecting danger to the
                body, but danger to values.
            </p>

            <p>The shift is subtle but profound:</p>

            <p>
                From:
                <br />
                “This is unfortunate.”
            </p>

            <p>
                To:
                <br />
                “This is unacceptable.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Repeated exposure builds faster activation.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.reply}>
                The sculptor is no longer removing large pieces.
                <br />
                It is defining lines.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>The Menopausal Recalibration</h2>

            <p className={styles.question}>
                “But something intensified recently,” Anamika said.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.reply}>
                “Yes,” the Being replied. “Biology participates in refinement.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Estrogen is not only reproductive; it modulates emotional processing. It
                influences serotonin stability, dopamine reward sensitivity, and cortisol
                regulation. For decades, it buffers emotional reactivity and softens stress
                responses.
            </p>

            <p>During perimenopause and menopause:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Estrogen fluctuates unpredictably.</li>
                <li>Emotional filtering reduces.</li>
                <li>Tolerance for misalignment decreases.</li>
                <li>Suppression of anger becomes harder.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is not emotional weakness.</p>
            <p>It is reduced sedation.</p>

            <p>
                What was once absorbed quietly now registers sharply.
            </p>

            <p>
                The nervous system becomes less willing to endure violations for the sake
                of social harmony.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.reply}>
                “It is as if the sculptor has put down the broad hammer and picked up a finer chisel.”
                <br />
                The details now matter.
                <br />
                Edges feel sharper.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>Why Bitterness Felt New</h2>

            <p className={styles.question}>
                “But why bitterness toward people?”
            </p>

            <p className={styles.reply}>
                “Because your cognition matured.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Earlier, injustice felt diffuse — systemic, unfortunate, abstract.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, your brain assigns agency.
            </p>

            <p>
                It distinguishes choice from accident.
            </p>

            <p>
                When the mind perceives repeated intentional violation, it mobilizes correction energy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Anger is mobilization.
                <br />
                Bitterness is mobilization without resolution.
            </p>

            <p>
                If anger is not metabolized — through action, dialogue, or reframing — it crystallizes.
            </p>

            <p>The stone begins to harden.</p>
            <p>But hardness is not the final sculpture.</p>
            <p>It is an intermediate stage.</p>

            <hr />

            <h2>The Critical Shift</h2>

            <p className={styles.question}>
                “There was a moment when I realized I did not like who I was becoming.”
            </p>

            <p className={styles.reply}>
                “That was awareness turning inward.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Chronic resentment sustains sympathetic activation. Cortisol remains elevated.
                Rumination reinforces grievance pathways. The brain narrows perception to protect its values.
            </p>

            <p>
                But high-order cortical processing allows abstraction.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead of:
                <br />
                “They are wrong.”
            </p>

            <p>
                You began asking:
                <br />
                “What structure allows this?”
                <br />
                “What pattern sustains this?”
                <br />
                “What incentive drives this behavior?”
            </p>

            <p>
                This cognitive reframing re-engages executive networks. It reduces personal hostility while preserving moral clarity.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.reply}>
                The sculptor’s strike is no longer seen as cruelty.
                <br />
                It is understood as shaping.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>Integration: Allowing the Form to Emerge</h2>

            <p className={styles.question}>
                “So what do I do with this intensity?”
            </p>

            <p className={styles.reply}>
                “You regulate it.
                <br /><br />
                Not by suppressing it.
                <br /><br />
                But by breathing through it.
                <br />
                By widening perception.
                <br />
                By separating person from pattern.
                <br />
                By correcting without hatred.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Integration means the hammer still strikes —
                but the stone no longer resists blindly.
            </p>

            <p>It yields strategically.</p>

            <p>
                Your breath steadies more quickly now.
                <br />
                Your tone lowers instead of sharpens.
                <br />
                Your posture aligns instead of tightens.
            </p>

            <p>This is not a return to innocence.</p>
            <p>It is conscious refinement.</p>

            <hr />

            <h2>Innocence Was Never Lost</h2>

            <p className={styles.reply}>
                “You think you lost innocence.
                <br /><br />
                But innocence was trust without data.
                <br /><br />
                Now you have data.
                <br /><br />
                The question is whether you let data turn into wisdom —
                or into rigidity.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Midlife does not corrupt character.
            </p>

            <p>
                It removes buffering and reveals core structure.
            </p>

            <p>
                If bitterness is integrated, it becomes discernment.
                <br />
                If intensity is regulated, it becomes authority.
                <br />
                If awareness is stabilized, it becomes presence.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.reply}>
                The sculptor was never trying to damage the stone.
                <br />
                It was revealing the form hidden inside it.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <p>
                Anamika sat in long silence.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.question}>
                “My brain did not betray me.”

                It evolved.
                <br /><br />
                And now you must decide whether you will identify as the stone —

            </p>

            <p>
                For the first time, Anamika did not feel hardened.
