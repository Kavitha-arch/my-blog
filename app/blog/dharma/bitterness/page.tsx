        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Intelligence does not replace innocence. It refines perception. What once felt like helpless observation
          now becomes pattern recognition. Violations that previously registered as discomfort now register as
          structural inconsistency — misalignment between value and action.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          The values have not changed. The nervous system has. The threshold for ambiguity has narrowed.
          Cognitive clarity has increased sensitivity to ethical distortion. What feels like lost innocence
          may in fact be heightened resolution.
        </p>

            “Innocence transformed into intelligence — yes. But what is new in me is bitterness.
            Earlier, I might have felt helpless when something violated my values.
            Now I feel an intense need to correct it.
            And when people repeatedly cause these violations,
            I feel something sharper. Something harder.
            Why has my brain rewired like this?”
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Bitterness is not the corruption of values. It is the collision between clarity and perceived powerlessness.
          When the mind recognizes preventable harm yet lacks systemic control, affect intensifies.

          <p className="mt-2 text-purple-800 leading-relaxed">
            “Your brain has not rewired toward bitterness.
            It has rewired toward agency.
            You no longer only detect misalignment —
            you believe correction is possible.
            Bitterness appears when action feels blocked.”

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Neuroscientifically, increased moral activation engages predictive networks and threat-detection circuitry.
          The body prepares for correction. If correction cannot occur, activation lingers.
          Lingering activation becomes contraction. Contraction, when repeated, feels like bitterness.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          The question, then, is not how to regain innocence —
          but how to engage injustice without chronic contraction.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          That inquiry leads naturally to the architecture of the Self.
