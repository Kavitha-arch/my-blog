        <h1>The Cost of Caring Alone</h1>

        <p>
          <em>
            Integrity doesn’t require endless engagement.
            <br />
            It requires alignment.
          </em>
        </p> 
        <h2>When alignment turns into exhaustion</h2>

        <p>
          An example scenario <br></br>
          In Anamika's work place, the person X misused his authority. Money was
          collected from clients and not deposited. I had proof.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet one powerful manager supported him for convenience, and most
          workers stayed passive. I tried to get others aligned. Instead of
          change, I got resistance and silence.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Anamika's integrity was intact — but her energy was leaking.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The hidden trap: trying to align others</h2>

        <p>
          Speaking your truth is healthy. Repeating it is understandable. Trying
          to make others see is exhausting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alignment cannot be transferred. Once your thoughts, words, and
          actions are aligned, your ethical work is complete.
        </p>

        <h2>Paying without agreeing</h2>

        <p>
          A small, unannounced charge was introduced. Paying it felt wrong. But
          fighting alone felt worse.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Paying is not approval when done consciously. Integrity is not
          symbolic suffering.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>A third path</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Pay, without moral closure</li>
          <li>Document quietly</li>
          <li>Stop leaking energy</li>
          <li>Wait for leverage, not validation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This is not surrender. It is strategic restraint.
        </p>

        <h2>What integrity actually asks</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I can see the truth without carrying the whole burden of correcting
            it.
          </p>
