Time feels suspended. From the hush emerges a colossal tree, its presence magnetic, its shade alive with a warm, unseen wind. I lay my journal at its roots and rest against its trunk. The world softens. My breath slows. Sleep takes me gently. When I awaken, the tree is no longer empty — a radiant being dwells within it, luminous and watching. I whisper, not with my voice but with my soul. It responds without words, guiding me inward. Through living visions and quiet revelations, it shows me my Dharma. What is revealed dissolves into ink, flowing naturally into the pages of my journal."}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","$L4",null,{"href":"/blog","className":"px-8 py-4 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg shadow hover:bg-blue-700 transition text-lg","children":"Read the Journal"}]]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"max-w-2xl text-center my-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-semibold mb-4","children":"About This Blog"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-600","children":"This blog weaves personal self-reflection into stories."}]]}]]}],[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/chunks/b8b013e77e1a3c04.css","precedence":"next"}],["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/3a7264bbbb0af4f1.js","async":true}]],["$","$L5",null,{"children":["$","$6",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@7"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
